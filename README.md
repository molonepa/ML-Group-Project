### Predicting COVID-19 Infections of Irish Healthcare Workers

In this group project, we predicted the number of healthcare workers who will be infected with COVID-19 in Ireland based on the number of ICU admissions in the preceding days. The input to our algorithm is the number of COVID-19 cases in healthcare workers. We then used linear regression, ridge regression and lasso regression to output a predicted number of healthcare workers who will be infected with COVID-19. This prediction will hopefully aid hospitals in ensuring they have adequate healthy staff working in the ICU. 

We recognise this problem as a regression problem so we have experimented with different regression models such as Linear, Ridge and Lasso regression models. Additionally, we experimented with using different features to make our predictions.
